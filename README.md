# My_first_project
Hello, welcome to my first project. I am Antonio GrgiÄ‡, and I decided to learn some basics of front-end development and showcase the results through this project.

Project Overview:
I have created three websites so far, and I am currently working on the fourth one. The first website is a 404 page, which is an error message and is designed to be simple. Each following website becomes more complex.

Order of Creation:

   1. 404 Website
   2. Terms of Use Website
   3. Index Website

Design:
All websites are built using CSS Grid, as I found it to be more challenging to learn and wanted to master it by using it throught the entire project.

Responsiveness:
I have made sure that all websites are responsive to different screen sizes. For demonstration purposes, I have tested them on the following resolutions: 1536, 1366, 1024, 768, 480, and 375. 

Conclusion:
Please note that the project is still a work in progress, and I will be updating it regularly.

I hope you enjoy exploring my code, and if you would like, you can suggest corrections or improvements to help me learn and enhance the project.

Thank you for your interest in my project!
